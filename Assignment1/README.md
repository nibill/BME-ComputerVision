# Computer Vision Assignments 2019

## Preparation
The assignments are written in Python. 
We recommend you use a virtual environment to isolate package installations for this project from system-wide packages.
Anaconda3 or virtualenv are both good choices. 
In the instructions below we will use Anaconda3.

Create an environment (here we call it "cv") and install the required packages for this project:
```
conda create -n cv python=3.7
conda activate cv
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda deactivate
```
That's all. You are ready to start coding!

## Jupyter Notebook
We provide skeleton code in form of Jupyter notebooks. 
Activate the environment and run Jupyter from the command line:
```
conda activate cv
jupyter-notebook
```
This should open a tab in your default browser. 
When you are done working on the assignments, you should deactivate the environment:
```
conda deactivate
```
